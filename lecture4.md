# What will we learn today?

- The power transformer
- The next part of power flow analysis: how to include transformers, and transformers with tap changers

You will be able to do exercises ... from the Ned Mohan's book.

## Hysteresis $B$ vs, $H$

Losses 

$\mu\_m$ vs $\mu\_0$

Max $B$ in core around 1.6 T

One of the core losses (or iron losses).

## Eddy currents

-> Laminated magnetic cores

One of the core losses (or iron losses).

---

## Copper losses 

---

## Non-ideal model
